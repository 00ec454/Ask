# Ask
Android runtime permissions make easy

# Why?

In marshmallow, android has introduced runtime permission check, that means when application runs, it asks user provide permission to run specific functionality. for example if you using Camera or saving files on external storage or location.

The android basic code to request permission is to complex and tedious to understand (if you don't trust me, check [here](http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html) :smiley: ). **Ask** is a library make asking for the particular permission easy for developer. This is very simple and light weight library with just few lines of code and you good to go.

## Demo( How it looks!)

| Ask for permission     | Show rationale |
| ---      | ---       |
| ![show permission](https://github.com/00ec454/Ask/blob/master/asset/permission_1.png) | ![show rationale](https://github.com/00ec454/Ask/blob/master/asset/rationale.png)         |

## How to use.

* Very first step is to include this library in your project by adding following entry into your project's gradle dependencies

```groovy
dependencies {
	compile 'com.vistrav:ask:1.2'
}
```

* Adding the necessary permissions into your project manifest file
* Add the following code in your class to request the runtime permissions
```java
        Ask.on(activity)
                .forPermissions(Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
                        , Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) //one or more permissions
                .withRationales("Location permission need for map to work properly", 
                        "In order to save file you will need to grant storage permission") //optional
                .when(new Ask.Permission() {
                    @Override
                    public void granted(List<String> permissions) {
                        Log.i(TAG, "granted :: " + permissions);
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void denied(List<String> permissions) {
                        Log.i(TAG, "denied :: " + permissions);
                    }
                }).go();

```

* Implement callback methods `granted` or `denied`
 * the `granted` method provides the list of granted permissions.
 * the `denied` method provides the list of denied permissions.
* The setting rationale message is optional but it would be good in case user has declined the permission, there is chance for developer to explain app user why specific permission is needed

1. `forPermissions` method takes one or more permissions as argument
2. `withRationales` method takes one or more rationale message, usually it is good to provide same number of rationale messages as number of permissions

**IMPORTANT: If your application is running in any android verion lesser than Marshamallow, the all, requested permissions will be granted by default and you can find then in list provided by `granted` method**
